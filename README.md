This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

# Deal Finder🛍️ - Smart Price Comparison Website

A modern, responsive web application built using **Next.js** and **Tailwind CSS**, designed to help users **compare products and prices across popular e-commerce platforms** such as Amazon, Flipkart, and Meesho — all in one place.

> ⚡ This is a **frontend-only prototype** built using **mock data**. No real API or live data scraping is implemented yet.

---

## 🚀 Features

- 🏠 **Home Page** – Clean hero section, popular categories, trending deals, and comparison preview  
- 🗂️ **Category-based Product Listing** – Displays products dynamically using mock data (`/products/[category]`)  
- 🔍 **Compare Products** – Compare up to **3 products side-by-side** (price, rating, offers, platform)  
- ❤️ **Wishlist UI** – Add/remove favorite products (mock UI only)  
- 📱 **Fully Responsive Design** – Built for desktop, tablet, and mobile users  
- 🌗 **Modern UI/UX** – Clean layout with Tailwind CSS and intuitive navigation

## 🧠 Purpose

Online shoppers often open multiple tabs to compare the same product across different platforms.  
This project solves that problem by **aggregating product information and allowing easy visual comparison**, saving time and improving decision-making.

---

## 🎯 Use Case

- Compare products from multiple e-commerce websites  
- View key product details like price, rating, and platform  
- Quickly decide where to buy from without switching tabs

# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
